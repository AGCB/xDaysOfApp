   #150: Hey designers, if you only know one thing about JavaScript, this is what I would recommend
   	 November 23, 2016
   	 CSS-Tricks

   	 https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/150-hey-designers-know-one-thing-javascript-recommend/

   	 Our app is a gradient background with 1 paragraph.
   	 When you click the paragraph you change it's background.

	Technical acrobatics shown....
	1- CSS3 linear gradient syntax.
	2- defining base and additional class styles
	3- assigning elements an id
	4- JS iffys
    5- addEventListener
    6- element.classList.toggle()

    and futher would be.
    1- playing with other gradients.
    2- more styles and more elements
    3- i believe this pattern goes away with VDom
       frameworks.
    4- iffys will go away as a pattern of controlling
       scope as more work is done using esModules spec
       The CSS-Tricks doesn't reference iffys, I won't 
       again either.  
    5- it doesn't HAVE to listen for clicks... 
       there are other options... we can also expand 
       what the function does.
    6.  the classList property has other functions besides
        toggle     

 -->
<style type="text/css">




/*the background for the whole screen
  */
	body {
	  background: linear-gradient(90deg,grey,deepPink);
	}
	/*our paragraph will have the default style and
	1 more (yay) with different linear gradient settings*/
	p {
		font-family: 'Aladin', cursive;
		font-size: 3em;
	  background: linear-gradient(90deg,blue,pink,yellow);
	}

	p.yay {
		font-family: 'Aladin', cursive;
	  background: linear-gradient(90deg,yellow,green,blue,red);
	}

</style>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Aladin" rel="stylesheet"> 
</head>

<body>
<!-- we need to hook into our paragraph so we will 
give it an id -->
<p id="ourParagraph">
	
goal of this one is to have a gradient on the screen.
when you clickit, it changes to a different gradient.
Changing both colors and # of colors

</p>

<p id="second">
	
This paragraph's logic is independent from our first.

<script>
(function app(){
	
  let p = document.getElementById("ourParagraph");
  p.addEventListener("click", function() {
    p.classList.toggle("yay");
    })

  let p2 = document.getElementById("second");
  p2.addEventListener("click", function() {
    p2.classList.toggle("yay");
    })

  ;})();
